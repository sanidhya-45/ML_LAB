(Question No. 5 is mot there)
Implement the following programs using Python without using Built In functions.

1. Model Measurement Analysis: Using any dataset and any classifier, calculate TP, TN, FP and
FN from sklearn library functions. Also calculate different metrics (Accuracy, Precision,
Recall(Sensitivity), F1-Score, MCC, Specificity, Negative Predictive Value) by defining our own
functions. Compare your values with scikit-learn&#39;s library functions. Get the result of
Confusion Matrix using sklearn. Using sklearn, plot the ROC &amp; AUC Curves for your test data
and random probabilities. Using sklearn, calculate the AUC of your test data and of random
probabilities. Interpret the results. Write the inference/analysis of each output. Expectation is
Supervised Learning Algorithms. Therefore, use any classifier.

2. Supervised Learning Algorithms - KNN: Build a KNN model for predicting if a person will
have diabetes or not with a high accuracy score. Perform some appropriate Pre-Processing
steps on the given dataset for better results. Implement the KNN algorithm on your own. Try
other possible processes that can be done to dataset and tuning the model to increase
accuracy such as Increase K value, Normalization and Different Distance Metrics. Perform
Feature Ablation Study. Additional Tries: Weight the features before doing KNN prediction.

3. Un-Supervised Learning Algorithms - K-Means Clustering: Build a K-Means Model for the
given dataset. Build a K-Means Model for the given Dataset. Use the Elbow or Silhouette
method to find the best possible K-value. Use the cost function as WCSS(Within Cluster Sum
of Squares). Curate a new data point and find which cluster it goes to. Write the inference.


Part B
Implement the following programs using Python.

1. Supervised Learning Algorithms - Simple Linear Regression (Univariant): Consider any
dataset from UCI repository. Create Simple Linear Regression models using the training data
set. Predict the scores on the test data and find the error in prediction (E.g. RMSE, MAE, LSE).
Include appropriate code snippets to visualize the model. Use Sub-Plots Interpret the result.

2. Supervised Learning Algorithms - Multiple Linear Regression (Multivariate): Consider any
dataset from UCI repository. Create Multiple Linear Regression models using the training
data set. Predict the scores on the test data and find the error in prediction (E.g. RMSE, MAE,
LSE). Include appropriate code snippets to visualize the model. Use Sub-Plots Interpret the
result. Write the Inference.

3. Probabilistic Supervised Learning - Naive Bayes(Binomial): Create a dataset from the sample
given to you(e.g. “Titanic, Play Tennis Probability”, “Shopper Buying Probability” etc.).
Perform the necessary pre-processing steps such as encoding. Train the model using Naive
Bayes Classifier for Binomial predictions. Give new test data and predict the classification
output. Handcode the classification probability and compare with the model output. Analyze
and write the inference.

4. Probabilistic Supervised Learning - Naive Bayes(Multinomial): Create a dataset from the
sample given to you(e.g. “Iris”, “Advertising” etc.). Perform the necessary pre-processing
steps such as encoding. Train the model using Naive Bayes Classifier for Multinomial
predictions. Give new test data and predict the classification output. Handcode the
classification probability and compare with the model output. Print the confusion matrix,
accuracy, precision, recall, sensitivity, specificity, MCC etc. Analyze and write the inference.

5. Artificial Neural Networks - Multi Layer Perceptron: Write a program to use a Multi Layer
Perceptron from sklearn for classifying an outcome for any dataset. The program should
contain functions to read the dataset from the file, pre-process it for encoding categorical
attributes and split the data into train and test. Train the model. Predict the output sample
test data. Perform Mini-Batch Training and plot the accuracy score for the train and test data.
Print the confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, sensitivity, specificity, MCC etc. Write
the Inference.

6. Supervised Learning Algorithms - Decision Trees: Implement decision trees considering a
data set of your choice. Create an ID3 Decision Tree. Implement the ID3 algorithm on your
own. Use a pre-defined sklearn library for both Entropy-Information Gain as well as Gini Index
calculation. Compare the results you got between your hand-coded algorithm and sklearn.
Draw the decision tree. Write the interference on the choice of the root node, the internal
nodes and the leaf nodes. Also calculate the Decision Tree model measurement metrics such
as confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, sensitivity, specificity, MCC etc.Write the
inference.

7. Supervised Learning Algorithms - Logistic Regression (Univariant): Implement logistic
regression and test it using any dataset which will be given to you. Give new test data and
predict the classification output. Handcode the classification probability and compare with
the model output. Print the confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, sensitivity,
specificity, MCC etc. Analyze and write the inference.

8. Un-Supervised Learning Algorithms - Hierarchical Clustering: Using any dataset implement
Hierarchical Clustering (AGNES and DIANA). Plot the Dendrogram for Hierarchical Clustering
and analyze your result. Plot the clustering output for the same dataset using these two
hierarchical techniques. Compare the results. Write the inference.
